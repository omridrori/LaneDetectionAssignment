# Lane Detection System

## Overview
This project implements a sophisticated lane detection system designed to perform the following functions:
- Lane Detection and Departure Warning
- Curvy Lane Detection
- Crosswalk Detection


## Project Results

The results of the system are demonstrated in the following video outputs:
- Lane Detection and Departure: `lane_departure_outputs.mp4`
- Curvy Lane Detection + varying lighting conditions : `output_curvey.mp4`
- Crosswalk Detection: `crosswalkVideo.mp4`

The complete project report detailing the methodologiesused is available in `image_processing_project.pdf`.
